The threading is divided into the message database thread and user database thread. The Action enum contains the actions that can be performed on the databases. 

Thread-safe procedures including creating a static object and using the synchronized keyword:

```java
public static final Object lock = new Object();
synchronized(lock){
    //thread-safe action
}
```


# MessageDatabaseThread.java
This class handles the threading for Message Database. The actions for the message database include getting sent messages, getting recieved messages, recovering messages, getting a user, sending a message, deleting a message, and editting a message.

The parameters for constructing a MessageDatabaseThread are:
```java
MessageDatabase messageDatabase
Action action
String[] values
```

The messageDabase variable stores the particular database the action is being formed for.

The action variable contains what action is being performed on the database: 
```java
EDIT_USER, UNBLOCK, GET_SENT_MESSAGES, GET_RECIEVED_MESSAGES, RECOVER_MESSAGES,
GET_USER, SEND_MESSAGE, DELETE_MESSAGE, EDIT_MESSAGE
```

"Values" contains the particular parameters to be performed with the actions. For example, in the EDIT_MESSAGE action, values[0] contains the message to be editted and values[1] contains the new message.

If there are not enough elements passed into the Values parameter for the particular action, an IndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown and program will print a notice to check the parameters. Other exceptions will have their stack traces printed. 

# UserDatabaseThread.java

The UserDatabaseThread handles the threading for the user database class. The actions for the userdatabase thread include creating a user, verifying login, changing a username, searching for a user, adding a friend, removing a friend, blocking a user, and unblocking a user.

The parameters for constructing a MessageDatabaseThread are:
```java
UserDatabase userDB
Action action
String[] values
```

userDB contains the particular user database to perform the actions on.

The enums for actions include: 
```java
SEARCH, ADD_FRIEND, REMOVE_FRIEND, BLOCK, CREATE_USER, VERIFY_LOGIN, CHANGE_USERNAME
```

Likewise, the Values variable contains the particular parameters to be performed with the actions. For example, in the CREATE_USER action, values[0]: username, values[1]: password, values[2]: password, values[3]: first name, values[4]:last name, values[5]: profile picture


If there are not enough elements passed into the Values parameter for the particular action, an IndexOutOfBoundsException will be thrown and program will print a notice to check the parameters. Other exceptions will have their stack traces printed.
